# RISC-V_ISA_CPU
Computer Architecture Final Project

The goal of this project is to create a full 32 bit CPU which follows the RISC-V ISA. It is meant to created from the ground up using Verilog HDL in Quartus Prime and simulated using Model-Sim Altera. This processor should perform R, I, S, and B type instructions from the RISC-V ISA, including load and store operations by using a built in data memory (RAM).

At the conclusion of this project, the CPU should be supported by additional hardware allowing it to be loaded onto a DE-10 Lite FPGA board using a switch for reset and pushbutton to control the clock. To display instruction outputs, four seven-segment displays should be utilized to show the output in binary coded decimal (BCD) form.
